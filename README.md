**Brief:**
The Olympic Games have always mixed pure sporting spectacle with national competition. During the Cold War the USA and the Soviet Union competed fiercely to win the most medals in each games. On a somewhat milder level, in Britain we often compare our medal count with that of Australia, one of our traditional sporting rivals. If you were in the UK during the summers of 2012 and 2016 you cannot have missed the excitement caused by the UK’s success relative to previous years. This competition is usually expressed in terms of the number of medals won by each country’s athletes (Figure 1 top panel). However, many interested watchers, especially those from smaller countries, have pointed out that the medal table is hardly a fair reflection of a country’s sporting prowess. Some countries have a strong tradition of sporting excellence, but are simply too small to make an impact in terms of total medals. These commentators would rather look at the per capita medal count (Figure 1 bottom panel).

Looking at the per capita map above though, we see that large areas of the world are still very under- represented. Specifically, poorer countries do not win many medals per head of population. There are many reasons for this, including a lack of investment in sport and facilities, and fewer individuals who are wealthy enough to devote their life to training. As such, it has been suggested that we should compensate for wealth when measuring a country’s Olympic performance. In this coursework, we will investigate how the number of medals a country wins can be predicted from national population and/or GDP, and how consistent these relationships are, using R. Begin by downloading the data file [here](https://github.com/its-imthiyas/Study-on-Olympic-Medals/blob/main/medal_pop_gdp_data_statlearn.csv).

This data file contains the following information for 71 countries (those that won at least one gold medal in each of the last three games):
* Country name (as recognised by the IOC)
* Population
* GDP (in billions of US dollars)
* Medals won in Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016
